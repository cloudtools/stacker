## 1.0.4 (2017-07-07)

- Fix issue w/ tail being required (but not existing) on diff/info/etc [GH-429]

## 1.0.3 (2017-07-06)

There was some reworking on how regions are handled, specifically around
s3 and where the buckets for both stacker and the awslambda lookup are created.
Now the stacker bucket will default to being created in the region where the
stacks are being created (ie: from the `--region` argument). If you want to
have the bucket be in a different region you now can set the
`stacker_bucket_region` top level config value.

For the awslambda hook, you also have the option of using `bucket_region` as
an argument, provided you are using a custom `bucket` for the hook. If you
are not using a custom bucket, then it will use the logic used above.
