## Upcoming release

## 1.5.0 (2018-10-14)

The big feature in this release is the introduction of "targets" which act as
sort of "virtual nodes" in the graph. It provides a nice way to logically group
stacks.

- Add support for "targets" [GH-572]
- Fix non-interactive changeset updates w/ stack policies [GH-657]
- Fix interactive_update_stack calls with empty string parameters [GH-658]
- Fix KMS unicode lookup in python 2 [GH-659]
- Locked stacks have no dependencies [GH-661]
- Set default profile earlier [GH-662]
- Get rid of recursion for tail retries and extend retry/timeout [GH-663]

## 1.4.1 (2018-08-28)

This is a minor bugfix release for 1.4.0, no major feature updates.

As of this release python 3.5+ support is no longer considered experimental, and should be stable.

Special thanks to @troyready for this release, I think most of these PRs were his :)

- allow raw cfn templates to be loaded from remote package\_sources [GH-638]
- Add missing config keys to s3 package source model [GH-642]
- Account for UsePreviousValue parameters in diff [GH-644]
- fix file lookup documented and actual return types [GH-646]
- Creates a memoized provider builder for AWS [GH-648]
- update git ref to explicitly return string (fix py3 bytes error) [GH-649]
- Lock botocore/boto to versions that work with moto [GH-651]

## 1.4.0 (2018-08-05)

- YAML & JSON codecs for `file` lookup [GH-537]
- Arbitrary `command` hook [GH-565]
- Fix datetime is not JSON serializable error [GH-591]
- Run dump and outline actions offline [GH-594]
- Helper Makefile for functional tests [GH-597]
- Python3 support!!! [GH-600]
- YAML blueprint testing framework [GH-606]
- new `add_output` helper on Blueprint [GH-611]

- Stricter config parsing - only allow unrecognized config variables at the top-level [GH-623]
- Documentation for the `default` lookup [GH-636]
- Allow configs without stacks [GH-640]

## 1.3.0 (2018-05-03)

- Support for provisioning stacks in multiple accounts and regions has been added [GH-553], [GH-551]
- Added a `--profile` flag, which can be used to set the global default profile that stacker will use (similar to `AWS_PROFILE`) [GH-563]
- `class_path`/`template_path` are no longer required when a stack is `locked` [GH-557]
- Support for setting stack policies on stacks has been added [GH-570]

## 1.2.0 (2018-03-01)

The biggest change in this release has to do with how we build the graph
of dependencies between stacks. This is now a true DAG.  As well, to
speed up performance we now walk the graph in a threaded mode, allowing
true parallelism and speeding up "wide" stack graphs considerably.

- assertRenderedBlueprint always dumps current results [GH-528]
- The `--stacks` flag now automatically builds dependencies of the given stack [GH-523]
- an unecessary DescribeStacks network call was removed [GH-529]
- support stack json/yaml templates [GH-530]
- `stacker {build,destroy}` now executes stacks in parallel. Parallelism can be controled with a `-j` flag. [GH-531]
- logging output has been simplified and no longer uses ANSI escape sequences to clear the screen [GH-532]
- logging output is now colorized in `--interactive` mode if the terminal has a TTY [GH-532]
- removed the upper bound on the boto3 dependency [GH-542]

## 1.2.0rc2 (2018-02-27)

- Fix parameter handling for diffs [GH-540]
- Fix an issue where SIGTERM/SIGINT weren't handled immediately [GH-543]
- Log a line when SIGINT/SIGTERM are handled [GH-543]
- Log failed steps at the end of plan execution [GH-543]
- Remove upper bound on boto3 dependency [GH-542]

## 1.2.0rc1 (2018-02-15)

The biggest change in this release has to do with how we build the graph
of dependencies between stacks. This is now a true DAG.  As well, to
speed up performance we now walk the graph in a threaded mode, allowing
true parallelism and speeding up "wide" stack graphs considerably.

- assertRenderedBlueprint always dumps current results [GH-528]
- stacker now builds a DAG internally [GH-523]
- The `--stacks` flag now automatically builds dependencies of the given stack [GH-523]
- an unecessary DescribeStacks network call was removed [GH-529]
- support stack json/yaml templates [GH-530]
- `stacker {build,destroy}` now executes stacks in parallel. Parallelism can be controled with a `-j` flag. [GH-531]
- logging output has been simplified and no longer uses ANSI escape sequences to clear the screen [GH-532]
- logging output is now colorized in `--interactive` mode if the terminal has a TTY [GH-532]


## 1.1.4 (2018-01-26)

- Add `blueprint.to_json` for standalone rendering [GH-459]
- Add global config for troposphere template indent [GH-505]
- Add serverless transform/CREATE changeset types [GH-517]

## 1.1.3 (2017-12-23)

Bugfix release- primarily to deal with a bug that's been around since the
introduction of interactive mode/changesets. The bug primarily deals with the
fact that we weren't deleting Changesets that were not submitted. This didn't
affect anyone for the longest time, but recently people have started to hit
limits on the # of changesets in an account. The current thinking is that the
limits weren't enforced before, and only recently has been enforced.

- Add S3 remote package sources [GH-487]
- Make blueprint dump always create intermediate directories [GH-499]
- Allow duplicate keys for most config mappings except `stacks` [GH-507]
- Remove un-submitted changesets [GH-513]

## 1.1.2 (2017-11-01)

This is a minor update to help deal with some of the issues between `stacker`
and `stacker_blueprints` both having dependencies on `troposphere`. It loosens
the dependencies, allowing stacker to work with any reasonably new version
of troposphere (anything greater than `1.9.0`). `stacker_blueprints` will
likely require newer versions of troposphere, as new types are introduced to
the blueprints, but it's unlikely we'll change the `troposphere` version string
for stacker, since it relies on only the most basic parts of the `troposphere`
API.

## 1.1.1 (2017-10-11)

This release is mostly about updating the dependencies for stacker to newer
versions, since that was missed in the last release.

## 1.1.0 (2017-10-08)

- `--max-zones` removed from CLI [GH-427]
- Ami lookup: add region specification [GH-433]
- DynamoDB Lookup [GH-434]

- MUCH Better handling of stack rollbacks & recreations [GH-473]

- Enable service\_role for cloudformation operations [GH-476]
- Allow setting stack description from config [GH-477]
- Move S3 templates into sub-directories [GH-478]

## 1.0.4 (2017-07-07)

- Fix issue w/ tail being required (but not existing) on diff/info/etc [GH-429]

## 1.0.3 (2017-07-06)

There was some reworking on how regions are handled, specifically around
s3 and where the buckets for both stacker and the awslambda lookup are created.
Now the stacker bucket will default to being created in the region where the
stacks are being created (ie: from the `--region` argument). If you want to
have the bucket be in a different region you now can set the
`stacker_bucket_region` top level config value.

For the awslambda hook, you also have the option of using `bucket_region` as
an argument, provided you are using a custom `bucket` for the hook. If you
are not using a custom bucket, then it will use the logic used above.
