# azcount is the # of AvailabilityZones to attempt to build in. You
# should build in as many as you can afford in order to provide for
# better fault tolerance. Note: Since this is all done in a VPC, you
# need to find out how many AZs can handle VPC subnets for the
# region you are building in. As of this writing, here are the max
# allowed azcount's for each zone:
#     us-east-1: 4, us-west-1: 2, us-west-2: 3, eu-west-1: 3
# Note: The minimum allowed azcount is 2.
