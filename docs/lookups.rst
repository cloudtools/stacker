=======
Lookups
=======

Stacker provides the ability to dynamically replace values in the config via a
concept called lookups. A lookup is meant to take a value and convert
it by calling out to another service or system.

A lookup is denoted in the config with the ``${<lookup type> <lookup
input>}`` syntax. If ``<lookup type>`` isn't provided, the default of
``output`` will be used.

Lookups are only resolved within `Variables
<terminology.html#variables>`_. They can be nested in any part of a YAML
data structure and within another lookup itself.

.. note::
  If a lookup has a non-string return value, it can be the only lookup
  within a value.

  ie. if `custom` returns a list, this would raise an exception::

    Variable: ${custom something}, ${output otherStack::Output}

  This is valid::

    Variable: ${custom something}


For example, given the following::

  stacks:
    - name: sg
      class_path: some.stack.blueprint.Blueprint
      variables:
        Roles:
          - ${output otherStack::IAMRole}
        Values:
          Env:
            Custom: ${custom ${output otherStack::Output}}
            DBUrl: postgres://${output dbStack::User}@${output dbStack::HostName}

The Blueprint would have access to the following resolved variables
dictionary::

  # variables
  {
    "Roles": ["other-stack-iam-role"],
    "Values": {
      "Env": {
        "Custom": "custom-output",
        "DBUrl": "postgres://user@hostname",
      },
    },
  }


stacker includes the following lookup types:

  - `output lookup`_
  - `kms lookup`_
  - `xref lookup`_
  - `rxref lookup`_
  - `file lookup`_
  - `ssmstore lookup`_
  - `dynamodb lookup`_
  - `envvar lookup`_
  - `ami lookup`_
  - `hook_data lookup`_
  - `custom lookup`_

.. _`output lookup`:

Output Lookup
-------------

The ``output`` lookup takes a value of the format:
``<stack name>::<output name>`` and retrieves the output from the given stack
name within the current namespace.

stacker treats output lookups differently than other lookups by auto
adding the referenced stack in the lookup as a requirement to the stack
whose variable the output value is being passed to.

You can specify an output lookup with the following syntax::

  ConfVariable: ${output someStack::SomeOutput}

.. _`kms lookup`:

KMS Lookup
----------

The ``kms`` lookup type decrypts its input value.

As an example, if you have a database and it has a parameter called
``DBPassword`` that you don't want to store in clear text in your config
(maybe because you want to check it into your version control system to
share with the team), you could instead encrypt the value using ``kms``.

For example::

  # We use the aws cli to get the encrypted value for the string
  # "PASSWORD" using the master key called 'myStackerKey' in us-east-1
  $ aws --region us-east-1 kms encrypt --key-id alias/myStackerKey \
      --plaintext "PASSWORD" --output text --query CiphertextBlob

  CiD6bC8t2Y<...encrypted blob...>

  # In stacker we would reference the encrypted value like:
  DBPassword: ${kms us-east-1@CiD6bC8t2Y<...encrypted blob...>}

  # The above would resolve to
  DBPassword: PASSWORD

This requires that the person using stacker has access to the master key used
to encrypt the value.

It is also possible to store the encrypted blob in a file (useful if the
value is large) using the ``file://`` prefix, ie::

  DockerConfig: ${kms file://dockercfg}

.. note::
  Lookups resolve the path specified with `file://` relative to
  the location of the config file, not where the stacker command is run.

.. _`xref lookup`:

XRef Lookup
-----------

The ``xref`` lookup type is very similar to the ``output`` lookup type, the
difference being that ``xref`` resolves output values from stacks that
aren't contained within the current stacker namespace, but are existing stacks
containing outputs within the same region on the AWS account you are deploying
into. ``xref`` allows you to lookup these outputs from the stacks already on
your account by specifying the stacks fully qualified name in the
CloudFormation console.

Where the ``output`` type will take a stack name and use the current context
to expand the fully qualified stack name based on the namespace, ``xref``
skips this expansion because it assumes you've provided it with
the fully qualified stack name already. This allows you to reference
output values from any CloudFormation stack in the same region.

Also, unlike the ``output`` lookup type, ``xref`` doesn't impact stack
requirements.

For example::

  ConfVariable: ${xref fully-qualified-stack::SomeOutput}

.. _`rxref lookup`:

RXRef Lookup
------------

The ``rxref`` lookup type is very similar to the ``xref`` lookup type,
the difference being that ``rxref`` will lookup output values from stacks
that are relative to the current namespace but external to the stack, but
will not resolve them. ``rxref`` assumes the stack containing the output
already exists.

Where the ``xref`` type assumes you provided a fully qualified stack name,
``rxref``, like ``output`` expands and retrieves the output from the given
stack name within the current namespace, even if not defined in the stacker
config you provided it.

Because there is no requirement to keep all stacks defined within the same
stacker YAML config, you might need the ability to read outputs from other
stacks deployed by stacker into your same account under the same namespace.
``rxref`` gives you that ability. This is useful if you want to break up
very large configs into smaller groupings.

Also, unlike the ``output`` lookup type, ``rxref`` doesn't impact stack
requirements.

For example::

  # in stacker.env
  namespace: MyNamespace

  # in stacker.yml
  ConfVariable: ${rxref my-stack::SomeOutput}

  # the above would effectively resolve to
  ConfVariable: ${xref MyNamespace-my-stack::SomeOutput}

Although possible, it is not recommended to use ``rxref`` for stacks defined
within the same stacker YAML config.

.. _`file lookup`:

File Lookup
-----------

The ``file`` lookup type allows the loading of arbitrary data from files on
disk. The lookup additionally supports using a ``codec`` to manipulate or
wrap the file contents prior to injecting it. The parameterized-b64 ``codec``
is particularly useful to allow the interpolation of CloudFormation parameters
in a UserData attribute of an instance or launch configuration.

Basic examples::

  # We've written a file to /some/path:
  $ echo "hello there" > /some/path

  # In stacker we would reference the contents of this file with the following
  conf_key: ${file plain:file://some/path}

  # The above would resolve to
  conf_key: hello there

  # Or, if we used wanted a base64 encoded copy of the file data
  conf_key: ${file base64:file://some/path}

  # The above would resolve to
  conf_key: aGVsbG8gdGhlcmUK

Supported codecs:
 - plain
 - base64 - encode the plain text file at the given path with base64 prior
   to returning it
 - parameterized - the same as plain, but additionally supports
   referencing CloudFormation parameters to create userdata that's
   supplemented with information from the template, as is commonly needed
   in EC2 UserData. For example, given a template parameter of BucketName,
   the file could contain the following text::

     #!/bin/sh
     aws s3 sync s3://{{BucketName}}/somepath /somepath

   and then you could use something like this in the YAML config file::

     UserData: ${file parameterized:/path/to/file}

   resulting in the UserData parameter being defined as::

     { "Fn::Join" : ["", [
       "#!/bin/sh\naws s3 sync s3://",
       {"Ref" : "BucketName"},
       "/somepath /somepath"
     ]] }

 - parameterized-b64 - the same as parameterized, with the results additionally
   wrapped in { "Fn::Base64": ... } , which is what you actually need for
   EC2 UserData

When using parameterized-b64 for UserData, you should use a local_parameter defined
as such::

  from troposphere import AWSHelperFn

  "UserData": {
    "type": AWSHelperFn,
    "description": "Instance user data",
    "default": Ref("AWS::NoValue")
  }

and then assign UserData in a LaunchConfiguration or Instance to self.get_variables()["UserData"].
Note that we use AWSHelperFn as the type because the parameterized-b64 codec returns either a
Base64 or a GenericHelperFn troposphere object.

.. _`ssmstore lookup`:

SSM Parameter Store Lookup
--------------------------

The ``ssmstore`` lookup type retrieves a value from the Simple Systems
Manager Parameter Store.

As an example, if you have a database and it has a parameter called
``DBUser`` that you don't want to store in clear text in your config,
you could instead store it as a SSM parameter named ``MyDBUser``.

For example::

  # We use the aws cli to store the database username
  $ aws ssm put-parameter --name "MyDBUser" --type "String" \
      --value "root"

  # In stacker we would reference the value like:
  DBUser: ${ssmstore us-east-1@MyDBUser}

  # Which would resolve to:
  DBUser: root

Encrypted values ("SecureStrings") can also be used, which will be
automatically decrypted (assuming the Stacker user has access to the
associated KMS key). Care should be taken when using this with encrypted
values (i.e. a safe policy is to only use it with ``no_echo`` CFNString
values)

The region can be omitted (e.g. ``DBUser: ${ssmstore MyDBUser}``), in which
case ``us-east-1`` will be assumed.

.. _`dynamodb lookup`:

DynamoDb Lookup
--------------------------

The ``dynamodb`` lookup type retrieves a value from a DynamoDb table.

As an example, if you have a Dynamo Table named ``TestTable`` and it has an Item
with a Primary Partition key called ``TestKey`` and a value named ``BucketName``
, you can look it up by using Stacker. The lookup key in this case is TestVal

For example::

  # We can reference that dynamo value
  BucketName: ${dynamodb us-east-1:TestTable@TestKey:TestVal.BucketName}

  # Which would resolve to:
  DBUser: stacker-test-bucket

You can lookup other data types by putting the data type in the lookup. Valid
values are "S"(String), "N"(Number), "M"(Map), "L"(List).

For example::

  ServerCount: ${dynamodb us-east-1:TestTable@TestKey:TestVal.ServerCount[N]}

  This would return an int value, rather than a string

You can lookup values inside of a map:

For example::

  ServerCount: ${dynamodb us-east-1:TestTable@TestKey:TestVal.ServerInfo[M].
                                                                ServerCount[N]}


.. _`envvar lookup`:

Shell Environment Lookup
------------------------

The ``envvar`` lookup type retrieves a value from a variable in the shell's
environment.

Example::

  # Set an environment variable in the current shell.
  $ export DATABASE_USER=root

  # In the stacker config we could reference the value:
  DBUser: ${envvar DATABASE_UER}

  # Which would resolve to:
  DBUser: root

You can also get the variable name from a file, by using the ``file://`` prefix
in the lookup, like so::

  DBUser: ${envvar file://dbuser_file.txt}

.. _`ami lookup`:

EC2 AMI Lookup
--------------

The ``ami`` lookup is meant to search for the most recent AMI created that
matches the given filters.

Valid arguments::

  region OPTIONAL ONCE:
      e.g. us-east-1@

  owners (comma delimited) REQUIRED ONCE:
      aws_account_id | amazon | self

  name_regex (a regex) REQUIRED ONCE:
      e.g. my-ubuntu-server-[0-9]+

  executable_users (comma delimited) OPTIONAL ONCE:
      aws_account_id | amazon | self

Any other arguments specified are sent as filters to the aws api
For example, "architecture:x86_64" will add a filter.

Example::

  # Grabs the most recently created AMI that is owned by either this account,
  # amazon, or the account id 888888888888 that has a name that matches
  # the regex "server[0-9]+" and has "i386" as its architecture.

  # Note: The region is optional, and defaults to the current stacker region
  ImageId: ${ami [<region>@]owners:self,888888888888,amazon name_regex:server[0-9]+ architecture:i386}

.. _`hook_data lookup`:

Hook Data Lookup
----------------

When using hooks, you can have the hook store results in the
`hook_data`_ dictionary on the context by setting *data_key* in the hook
config.

This lookup lets you look up values in that dictionary. A good example of this
is when you use the `aws_lambda hook`_ to upload AWS Lambda code, then need to
pass that code object as the *Code* variable in the `aws_lambda blueprint`_
dictionary.

Example::

  # If you set the "data_key" config on the aws_lambda hook to be "myfunction"
  # and you name the function package "TheCode" you can get the troposphere
  # awslambda.Code object with:

  Code: ${hook_data myfunction::TheCode}

.. _`custom lookup`:

Custom Lookup
--------------

A custom lookup may be registered within the config.
